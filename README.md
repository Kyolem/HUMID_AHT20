# HUMID_AHT20
#### This is a library to use a AHT20 with many microcontroller who use Arduino and platformIO IDE.
#### I made this library with my friend Mathieu.
#### You have diffferent fonction with their uses :

` bool begin(uint8_t Adress) ` 
This fonction is use to begin the transmission with the DS3231's adress.    
She return True for no problem and False if there is a problem.

` bool getValues() `   
This fonction is use to get the actual values.  
It change the values of the variables :  
float theTemperature,    
float theHumidity  


` float theTemperature `  
This variable stock the value of the temperature  

` float the Humidity `  
This variable stock the value of the humidity
